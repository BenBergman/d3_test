- [] test all tests
- [] wire up sliders to trigger recalculation
- [] integrate dividend credits into marginal rate...?
    - How does this credit affect the marginal rate? The marginal rate is the rate of tax owed on the next dollar of regular income. A credit will not shift or scale the marginal rate, but non-refundable credits should clip the marginal rate down to 0...?
    - Is the current marginal rate setup working for the non-refundable credit display section?
        - I think that is what the `if (tax_owed == 0)` section is for
